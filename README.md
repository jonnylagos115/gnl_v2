# gnl_v2
My custom GNL project
This project contains a function that allows you to read a line ending
with a newline character from a file descriptor.

This project helped me gain deeper understanding in the following:
1.) Allocations, whether they happen in the stack memory or heap memory
2.) The manipulation and the life cycle of a buffer
3.) The unexpected complexity implied in the use of one or many static variables (new concept I've learned)
4.) More familiarity with the use of a structure
